This is a quiz app that has two different profile access types and displays to go along with them. 

the first acess type is admin: 
Admins can create quizez, view quiz stats, and add/remove other users admin status. 

the other acess type is users: 
Users can only take quizes and view there results.

NOTE:
this will not work becuase I removed my datbase info but the code is all there.
